My implementation of the K-mean clustering algorithm with visualization. 
The code works for up to 7 clusters, for easiness of color coding. I am also assuming that the dimensionality of the data is larger than 1. The algorithm
can plot the clusters in either 2 or 3 dimensions, and uses the PCA to reduce the dimensionality of the data to 3 if larger.
